# BUY MY SHOES BACKEND REPO
The repository was created to serve as my backend API for my selling shoes app.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* RUBY
* RUBY ON RAILS
* POSTMAN
* POSTGRES 

## APPROACH TAKEN
- This application was coded using Ruby on Rails to create a JSON API with one model (shoe) with full CRUD available. 
- Postgres is used for my database and Postman was used to test the routes. 

## LINK TO API 
* https://github.com/ajaocodes/backbuymyshoes.git 

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
- Create a user model.
- Allow users to sign up and only be able to edit or delete the post that each user create. 
- Create some authentication to protect each post.
- Create a mobile app.
